Building ML models to predict whether dragon's would invest in your pitch.

My conjecture is that it is possible to predict whether Dragons, who I consider Venture Capitalists, will invest based on the previous investments in the program.

The labourous part is to transcribe the programs into values of a table. I have done it for some episode to get about 24 data points. It seems a promising candidate for crowdsourcing.
